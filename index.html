			<h2>
				Once a negotiating tool, tariffs now sit at the centre of U.S. foreign policy. Their reach
				extends far beyond trade balances.
			</h2>
			<p>
				U.S. President Donald Trump’s reign has become synonymous with trade tariffs or threats of
				them. The approach intensified earlier this month after he directed U.S. forces to capture
				Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro, an operation he personally ordered and oversaw. The
				mission set the stage for another wave of tariff threats as he repeatedly invoked trade
				measures to advance foreign policy goals. In his second term, tariffs have become Mr.
				Trump’s default foreign-policy weapon that he now deploys reflexively to coerce allies and
				adversaries alike, often untethered from conventional trade disputes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Weeks after Maduro’s capture, Mr. Trump arrived at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland’s
				Davos boasting about America’s economic strength and floated a plan to take over Greenland,
				threatening tariffs on key European allies if they refused to sell the icy territory.
			</p>
			<p>
				That approach was first tested and developed during the U.S.–China trade war of Mr. Trump’s
				first term, when tariffs became the primary instrument of economic statecraft between the
				world’s two largest economies. What began as an effort to narrow trade deficits and counter
				Beijing’s industrial policies instead hardened into a prolonged confrontation that reshaped
				global supply chains.
			</p>
			<p>
				By America’s 250th year, a country that once championed free trade has become the world’s
				foremost practitioner of punitive tariffs. Analysts of global industrial competition have
				noted that this shift coincides with a deeper divergence between the United States and
				China.
			</p>
			<p>
				In his book Breakneck: China’s Quest to Engineer the Future, Dan Wang describes China as an
				“engineering state” that competes through relentless capacity-building, constructing
				factories, ports and supply chains at speed and scale, while the United States increasingly
				functions as a legalistic society, where policy change is slowed by litigation, regulatory
				process and institutional veto points.
			</p>

			<p>
				The result, Wang argues, is that China has outperformed the United States not by rejecting
				capitalism but by executing it more aggressively. Against that backdrop, Trump’s turn to
				tariffs represents not a revival of free-market leadership but a move toward coercive,
				transactional diplomacy, in which trade barriers are used as instruments of state power
				rather than tools of economic integration.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Trump also warned January 26 he would raise tariffs on South Korea on autos, lumber and
				pharmaceuticals because its legislature had not approved a trade framework which was
				finalised in October, and included investment promises by South Korea alongside tariff cuts
				by the United States. Since then, it has remained in a legal limbo in South Korea.
			</p>

			<p>
				The South Korea tension reflected a pattern that has defined Trump’s second term: tariffs
				deployed less as trade policy and more as leverage to extract political or investment
				concessions.
			</p>

			<p>
				Whether Mr. Trump’s tariffs have benefitted Americans is hotly contested but it is generally
				accepted that it’s changing the world order.
			</p>
			<h2>No industry and no country has been spared</h2>
			<p>
				Long time allies have also been hit with blanket duties: Canada’s goods not covered by the
				U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA) were hit with a 35% tariff rate, up from 25%, last
				August after Mr. Trump signed an executive order citing drug smuggling.
			</p>

			<p>
				Brazil, previously spared heavy duties, suddenly saw more than half of its exports subject
				to a 50% tariff in July 2025. Sectors such as civil aircraft, energy and orange juice were
				excluded, but meat, coffee and sugar exporters warne
			</p>
			<h2>Weaponising old trade laws</h2>
			<p>This shift has been enabled by the creative use of old trade laws.</p>

			<p>
				The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 authorises Section 232 tariffs when imports threaten
				national security. Mr. Trump first used this in his first term to impose duties on steel and
				aluminium and later expanded it in 2025 to include timber, copper, pharmaceuticals and
				semiconductors.
			</p>

			<p>
				Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows “safeguard” measures to protect a domestic
				industry from surges of imports. He used it to tax washing machines and solar panels. The
				most flexible authority is Section 301, which authorises tariffs against unfair trade
				practices. Mr. Trump invoked Section 301 to penalise what he said were China’s forced
				technology transfers and later used it as a bargaining chip with countries ranging from
				Brazil to the Philippines.
			</p>

			<p>
				In April 2025 he went further, citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of
				1977. He declared a national emergency over the U.S. trade deficit and announced “Liberation
				Day” tariffs. Under this order he imposed a 10% baseline tariff on all imports effective 5
				April 2025 and said reciprocal rates up to 25 percent would apply beginning 9 April.
			</p>

			<p>Liberation Day marked a turning point.</p>

			<p>
				Trump said the goal was “reciprocity,” arguing that American firms faced higher tariffs
				abroad.
			</p>

			<p>
				The president has justified subsequent tariffs on a variety of grounds. In July 2025 he
				levied a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods and said it was retaliation for Brazil’s prosecution
				of former president Jair Bolsonaro and regulation of U.S. social media companies.
			</p>

			<p>
				On 17 January Mr. Trump announced he would apply an extra 10% tariff on Denmark, UK,
				Finland, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden “until such time as a Deal is
				reached for the complete and total purchase of Greenland.”
			</p>

			<p>This is planned to begin on 1 February, and increase to 25% on 1 June 2026.</p>

			<p>
				British Prime Minister Keir Starmer responded saying imposing tariffs on allies pursuing
				collective NATO security was “completely wrong.”
			</p>
			<h2>New trade alliances forming</h2>
			<p>America’s trading partners are responding by diversifying away from the U.S.</p>

			<p>Canada, hit by 35% tariffs, is seeking other markets.</p>

			<p>
				Its energy minister Tim Hodgson said at the Indian Energy Week conference on 27 January that
				exporting 98% of Canada’s energy to the United States was a “strategic blunder” and said
				Canada wants to supply crude oil, liquefied natural gas and uranium to India.
			</p>

			<p>
				India and the European Union have gone further, concluding a long coveted free trade
				agreement on India’s 76th Republic Day on 26 January 2026. The accord, which trade secretary
				Rajesh Agrawal called “balanced and forward looking,” will be formally signed after legal
				vetting and implemented within a year.
			</p>

			<p>
				It opens the bloc of 27 nations and India, together accounting for a quarter of global GDP
				and 2 billion consumers, to free trade in goods. Negotiations gathered momentum after
				Washington imposed a 50% tariff on some Indian goods and U.S. allies pushed back against Mr.
				Trump’s tariff threats and his bid to take over Greenland.
			</p>

			<p>
				Under the deal described as “mother of all deals” by European Commission President Ms. Von
				der Leyen, the EU will cut tariffs on 99.5% of Indian goods over seven years, while India
				will slash duties on imports like cars and spirits and reduce tariffs on autos to 10% over
				five years.
			</p>

			<p>
				After being hit by tariffs, countries are diversifying reserves and exploring regional
				alliances. Mr. Trump’s second term has reshaped global trade. Mr. Trump’s tariffs spare
				neither neighbours nor allies. The response has been predictable: allies hedge, rivals
				harden, and global trade is reorganising itself around reduced exposure to U.S. volatility.
